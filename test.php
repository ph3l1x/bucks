                        By the time he was 14 years old, he began working in the shop installing parts and repairing
                        4x4’s alongside his brother and sister. In 2003, his brother and sister took on a family
                        proprietorship, and in 2009 Jeff took over as a sole proprietorship. In his off time away from
                        running the shop, Jeff enjoys outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, shooting, 4 wheeling,
                        and spending all of it with his family.
